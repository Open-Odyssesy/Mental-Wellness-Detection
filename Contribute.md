## üß† About the Project

The Mental Wellness Detection System is an open-source tool designed to analyze digital data (such as social media posts, chat transcripts, or other text-based content) to identify patterns and indicators related to mental health and well-being. Our goal is to create a robust, ethical, and accessible tool that can be used by researchers, counselors, and community organizations to better understand and support individuals' mental wellness.

**Key features include:**

* **Dataset-Driven Model:** Trained on authentic mental health survey data.
* **WEMWBS-Inspired Scoring:** A Wellness Score (0-100) reflecting positive mental health indicators.
* **Random Forest Classifier:** An advanced ML algorithm for depression level prediction.
* **Real-Time API Integration:** Live data fetching from Reddit and X/Twitter.
* **Flask Web Interface:** An interactive web app for public access.
* **Personalized Reports:** Detailed wellness analysis with actionable improvement suggestions.

By contributing to this project, you're helping to build a tool with a real-world impact.
